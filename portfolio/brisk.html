			<h3>SLO Hacks 2020</h3>
			<p>A hackathon organized by Cal Poly students, biggest in the central coast.</p>

			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
				<p>Through a survey at the hackathon, we found that the majority of the attending college students do not micromanage their spendings. They feel that it takes up too much time energy out of their day. Not managing money can lead to overspending, making people another step away from being a successful adult. A good financial management should be visually appealing and functionally effective.</p> 
			<h3>Vision</h3>
				<p>To create a financial management app usable in any occasion for quick entry of data.</p>
			<h3>Features</h3>
				<ol>
					<h4>Reciept Scanner</h4>
						<p>Our programmers implemented our reciept scanning function using the <span class="highlight">Google Vision API</span>. With this we were were able to read the store name and total price. We built a library for the scanner to categorize the purchase into a category. We would want to improve this in the future using a pre-existing database of store names. Unfortunately, we were not able to read the individual item names and prices due to the varying formatting of different reciepts.</p>
					<h4>Spreadsheet Sync</h4>
						<p>Using the <span class="highlight">Google Sheets API</span>, we were able to gather the data into a personal spreadsheet. Since users will log into BRISK using their Google account, the app can automatically sync the data with a spreadsheet. With this feature, users can safely manipulate their logged data however they want.</p>
					<h4>Budget Bars</h4>
						<p>This feature shown in our Figma high-fidelity prototype is for users to easily keep track of spendings per timeframe. <span class="highlight">At a glance</span> they are able to see how much of their pre-determined budget they have spent so far. They have no need to do any of the number-crunching; all you need to do is open the app and take a quick look! </p>
