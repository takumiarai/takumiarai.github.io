            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>
                Our team participated in this hackathon to create a <span class="highlight">FinTech Mobile App</span> that can help people manage their spendings easier and faster. To accomplish this goal, we created a high-fidelity
                prototype on Figma and a feature implementation written in Python.
            </p>

            <div class="initial">
                <h3>Initial Planning</h3>
                <p>To compete with the limited time we had, we quickly hashed out our initial direction and user interface ideas.</p>

                <h3>Research Survey</h3>
                <p>
                    Through a survey at the hackathon, we found that half of the pool <span class="highlight">did not manage their spendings.</span> They feel that it <span class="highlight">takes up too much time</span> out of their day.
                    They need a popular financial management that is <span class="highlight">visually appealing, fast, and effective.</span>
                </p>

            <div class="persona">
                <h3>Persona Development</h3>
                <p>
                    We then created two personas to <span class="highlight">keep our vision in focus</span>. This helped us solidify our idea of creating a simple, visually appealing, fast mobile app. Hence, we named it brisk. We also
                    created two scenarios to metally visualize the app.

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    We found that the best financial management apps have an appealing user interface and other features to automate the financial management. Those features connecting bank accounts and using geolocations. However, we
                    thought those <span class="highlight">features were too invasive on the users' personal information</span>. We kept our focus on creating an app that involves local input, synced to their personal Google Spreadsheet.

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>To create a financial management app with <span class="highlight">receipt scanning and Google Spreadsheets syncing</span> capability.</p>

            <div class="features">
                <h3>Features</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Receipt Scanner</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our programmers implemented our receipt scanning function using the <span class="highlight">Google Vision API</span>. With this we were were able to read the store name and total price. We built a library for the
                            scanner to categorize the purchase into a category. We would want to improve this in the future using a pre-existing database of store names. Unfortunately, we were not able to read the individual item names and
                            prices due to the varying formatting of different receipts.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Spreadsheet Sync</h4>
                        <p>
                            Using the <span class="highlight">Google Sheets API</span>, we were able to gather the data into a personal spreadsheet. Since users will log into BRISK using their Google account, the app can automatically sync
                            the data with a spreadsheet. With this feature, users can safely manipulate their logged data however they want.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Budget Bars</h4>
                        <p>
                            This feature shown in our Figma high-fidelity prototype is for users to easily keep track of spendings per timeframe. <span class="highlight">At a glance</span> they are able to see how much of their
                            pre-determined budget they have spent so far. They have no need to do any of the number-crunching; all you need to do is open the app and take a quick look!
                        </p>

            <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
            <p>
                We started our Figma prototype under the name of "Brisk", with the idea of having a bright blue gradient glowing in a dark-mode-like UI. At this stage, we implemented the wireframing and figured out the general flow of the
                app. As we kept building the prototype, we found that it <span class="highlight">did not look good with the screen shape of the iPhone X</span>. Then, we decided to rebrand it as "Haya", with a
                <span class="highlight">brighter interface, with more rounded designs</span>.
            </p>

	            <p>
	                After an allnighter reworking the figma prototype, we barely made it in time to pitch our product to the judges. We pitched a quick overview with the problem statement, vision statement, and design, followed by a demo of our implementation of the receipt scanning, spreadsheet syncing feature. We were selected as the "Best Image and Object Detection Hack"! I was so relieved to know that our hard work paid off. This was the best team I have ever worked with, and I'm grateful of the learning experience I had with my first ever Figma prototype.
