		<h2>Event</h2>
			<h3>SLO Hacks 2020</h3>
			<a href="https://www.slohacks.com/"><img src="images/slo-hacks-logo.png" alt="Logo of SLO Hacks."></a>
			<p>A hackathon organized by Cal Poly students, biggest in the central coast.</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Project</h2>
			<p>I created the inital prototype called "BRISK", which was eventually rebranded by Tyler as <a href="https://devpost.com/software/brisk">"Haya"</a>. He redesigned the interface with modern trends and iOS designs in mind. Although his iteration made the prorotype look better, most of the functionality was made by me when it was called "Brisk". I have much more to learn, but I am proud to show this as my first complete Figma prototype!</p>

			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
				<p>Through a survey at the hackathon, we found that the majority of them <span class="highlight">do not manage their spendings.</span> They feel that it <span class="highlight">takes up too much time energy</span> out of their day. Not managing money can lead to overspending, putting them another step away from being adulthood. To take care of this problem, they need a good financial management that is <span class="highlight">visually appealing and functionally effective.</span></p>
			<h3>Vision</h3>
				<p>To create a financial management app usable in any occasion for <span class="highlight">quick entry of data</span>. 
			<h3>Features</h3>
				<ol>
					<h4>Reciept Scanner</h4>
						<p>Our programmers implemented our reciept scanning function using the <span class="highlight">Google Vision API</span>. With this we were were able to read the store name and total price. We built a library for the scanner to categorize the purchase into a category. We would want to improve this in the future using a pre-existing database of store names. Unfortunately, we were not able to read the individual item names and prices due to the varying formatting of different reciepts.</p>
					<h4>Spreadsheet Sync</h4>
						<p>Using the <span class="highlight">Google Sheets API</span>, we were able to gather the data into a personal spreadsheet. Since users will log into BRISK using their Google account, the app can automatically sync the data with a spreadsheet. With this feature, users can safely manipulate their logged data however they want.</p>
					<h4>Budget Bars</h4>
						<p>This feature shown in our Figma high-fidelity prototype is for users to easily keep track of spendings per timeframe. <span class="highlight">At a glance</span> they are able to see how much of their pre-determined budget they have spent so far. They have no need to do any of the number-crunching; all you need to do is open the app and take a quick look! </p>
				</ol>

			<h3>Team Members</h3>
			<p>The project idea was pitched by Andrew, who found that the pre-existing financial management apps were not good enough for his needs. He wished that he could use both a reciept scanning and spreadsheet syncing function.</p>
			<ol>
				<h4>UI Designers:</h4>
					<p>Together we created a survey to gather information on whether financial management was relevant among college students. Once we found that this was a marketable audience, we decided on the vision and target audience. We developed two personas/case-studies before getting started on the prototyping. For the low-fidelity prototyping we separately made our own, for them to be compared and combined for the final prototype. Although it was our first time, we managed to use Figma to create a <span class="highlight">responsive prototype</span>.</p>

					<h5>Takumi Arai</h5>
					<p>Project leading, case-studies, wireframing, high-fidelity prototyping.</p>

					<h5>Tyler Matsuzaki</h5>
					<p>Conducting the survey, creating the logos and icons, branding.</p>
				<h4>Programmers:</h4>
					<p>Our programmers, both Computer Science students at Cal Poly, learned how to use the <span class="highlight">Google Vision and Sheets API</span> to implement the app's features in order to show the judges our vision in action. </p>

					<h5>Andrew Lai</h5>
					<p>Figuring out Google View API, string parsing, categorization of scanned reciepts with handmade local library.</p>

					<h5>Otakar Andersek</h5>
					<p>Figuring out Google Sheets API </p>
