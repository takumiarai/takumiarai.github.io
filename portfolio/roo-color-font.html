            <p class="mt-1 mx-auto text-muted">Color palette and typeface of the redefined design system.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">Roopairs is a startup based in San Luis Obispo, innovating a minimal yet powerful service field management software for repair and maintenance companies. As their Product Design Intern, I had the opportunity to redefine their typeface and color palette.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">Through interviews, we found that our users experienced readability issues with our app. With my co-intern Tyler, we did some research and investigated our UI to discover that the app's contrast levels did not pass the industry standards. For users to have a smooth experience, we need a more clearly readable color system, with focus on gray levels. They also struggled to see our smaller, 12 point fonts.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">In my previous quarter, I updated and reorganized their prototype files on Adobe XD. Throughout this process, I found inconsistencies in their typography. Sizing and weights were slightly different, and it gave the app a weak sense of hierarchy.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">The core of these design problems was the lack of a design system. The startup launched off the ground purely with the vision of the CEO and CTO, so they worked without a documented design system. Now that the software and company must expand, there was a need to start a well-documented design system.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">I discussed this with my mentor and Roopairs CEO, David Batrolomucci, and he gave me the great opportunity to give a presentation addressing the problems and action plan. To summarize, the presentation looked like this:</p>
            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3">The Problem</h4>
            <ol class="mx-3">
              <li>Users struggled to see the screen under outdoor glare. Our color system does not produce enough contrast.</li>
              <li>Users struggled to read the smaller fonts, even indoors. Our typeface underperforms at low pixel-counts.</li>
              <li>The app's font does not have enough of a weight difference to effectively show hierarchy. It limits design possibilities.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">We came up with a solution to solve these problems.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3">The Solution</h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3"><strong>Build a Design System and redefine Color and Typography.</strong> It will include:</p>
            <ol class="mx-2">
              <li>A color system to satisfy usability standards, making the app more readable and usable.</li>
              <li>A type system that will expand design possibilities and provide clarity to our interface.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">To accomplish this, we dove into research with the goal of gaining a better understanding about color, typography, and design systems. Through research, we found that:</p>
