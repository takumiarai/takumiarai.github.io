            <p class="mt-1 mx-auto text-muted">Color palette and typeface of the redefined design system.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">I built a Color and Typography Design System to resolve accessibility and usability issues. Through research, I learned about the technical requirements with colors and fonts, and how to create an effective design system using Figma.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3"><strong>The Problem</strong></h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">Our users were experiencing readability issues with the app. They struggled to see the interface under outdoor glare, and the smaller fonts were hard to read.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">I researched online across many UX articles and discovered two things. The interface was not producing enough contrast, and our font Nunito did not perform well on screens.</p>
            <img src="../images/roo-old-ui.png" class="rounded-3 mx-3" alt="A screenshot of Roopairs old UI">
            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3"><strong>The Solution</strong></h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">We set two specific goals to solve this problem:</p>
            <ol class="mx-3">
              <li>Generate a color system that will help fulfill color contrast standards.</li>
              <li>Generate a type system that improves brand identity and provides a better visual balance.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3"><strong>Requirements</strong></h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">To accomplish these goals, we had to intialize a design system. I researched online to learn about how to create an effective design system. Then I found Mailchimp and ServiceTitan's design system, where they provided a simple and purposeful documentation of their interface design. With this as my primary source of reference, I noted several things:</p>
            <ul class="mx-2">
              <li>Colors should have meaning corresponding to color psychology.</li>
              <li>Colors and types should include documentation of usages.</li>
              <li>Colors should have a tint and shade.</li>
              <li>The typography should include a documentation of its intended feel.</li>
              <li>The design system should be created on Figma, for its useful cloud library feature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">Building a design system will make our product more consistent, accessible, and reliable. It will also greatly help the future team to have a more efficient and effective design process.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3"><strong>Color</strong></h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">Initally, I used Material design's color tool to generate an accessible set of colors. This color palette unfortunately did not get approved because they wanted a wider variety of colors including orange and yellow. Then we decided to use paletton.com to generate a color palette with a combination of a triad and tetrad color combo. For our gray colors, we used Material design's color set.</p>
            <img src="../images/final-palette.png" class="rounded-3 mx-3" alt="Our final, approved color palette.">
            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3"><strong>Typography</strong></h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">Rubik has always been the font of our logomark, but it was not used for our interface. I looked more into Rubik and found some advantages:</p>
            <ul class="mx-2">
              <li>The monospace numerical characters give an analog aesthetic to the dollar values.</li>
              <li>The variety of font weights allows for a better expression of hierarchy.</li>
              <li>The higher x-height provides better legibility at smaller sizes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">Yay! We then prototyped several screens to check its readability. I used a Figma plugin to measure the color contrast as we developed the new screens.</p>
            <img src="../images/roo-new-ui.png" class="rounded-3 mx-3" alt="Screenshots of the new UI.">
            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3"><strong>The Result</strong></h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">Once the new color pallete and type system were approved, I created the design system on Figma. Now that we have a Figma team library with the new design system, the new color and type system are set in stone and the front-end team can start working updating the code base of styles.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3"><strong>Challenges</strong></h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">The biggest challenge with this project was in making design decisions with limited technical knowledge. Since I am not an experienced professional in color, I relied on online software to generate a color palette while making sure that it passes the contrast standards. Althought I gave my best effort in creating an effective color palette, I'm sure that some adjustments will have to be made before the app is officially deployed. However, I do believe this project was a confident starting point for our new design system.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-2 mx-3"><strong>Looking Forward</strong></h4>
            <p class="mt-2 mx-3">Starting here, we are continuing to work on the design system by setting up an atomic design system and creating components to be used on every new screen we design. I hope that my efforts made for this document will help the product grow in a good direction.</p>
